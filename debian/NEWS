multipath-tools (0.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Socket activation as introduced in 0.9.4-6 was turned off again,
  as upstream does not support it and claims it does not work.

  Please make sure you have multipathd.service enabled:

    systemctl enable multipathd.service

multipath-tools (0.9.4-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  Booting from multipathed devices has significantly changed. It is recommended
  testing your specific setup still boots properly, if you rely on this.

  SysV init scripts have been removed, as they may clash with socket activation
  and upgrade scenarios, especially when multipathd itself is not needed.

multipath-tools (0.9.4-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  The systemd service for multipathd is now entirely socket-activated.  On
  new installations without any multipath device present in the system,
  only multipathd.socket will be enabled and active.  If there are
  multipath devices available, then multipath.service will be activated (but
  not enabled).

  If you are upgrading from an existing installation and would like to use
  socket activation from now on, please manually disable
  multipathd.service and enable multipathd.socket:

    systemctl disable multipathd.service
    systemctl enable multipathd.socket

  However, please keep in mind that socket activation does NOT work if
  your root partition is located on a multipath device (in other words,
  if the multipath-tools-boot package is installed).  If that is your
  case, then keep multipathd.service enabled:

    systemctl enable multipathd.service

multipath-tools (0.7.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  systemd support is well integrated for multipath-tools now. The old
  initscripts are still provided and will be supported on a best effort basis
  but users are advised to move to a systemd based setup

multipath-tools (0.5.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  The systemd support has been dropped.

  Device Mapper multipath is a core component in the SAN Stack. The
  flexibility provided by shell init scripts were flexible. With
  systemd, it is not the same anymore. We sure can create shell scripts
  and pass it to systemd to run, but then it forfeits the philosophy of
  systemd that "shell is evil". So rather that passing shell units to
  systemd, we'll let systemd run this service in SysV compatibility
  mode.

multipath-tools (0.4.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  udev, which provides scsi_id, moved the binary to /lib/udev.
  The old name will stop working in the future.

  The default config now uses /lib/udev/scsi_id. And you have to
  update /etc/multipath.conf by hand to reflect the new location.

multipath-tools (0.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version removes creation of devices via udev in /dev. All
  device-mapper devices are created by libdevmapper in /dev/mapper.

  To readd the creation of devices in /dev, add the following line to
  the udev rules (e.g. /etc/udev/rules.d/multipath.rules):
  KERNEL=="dm-[0-9]*", PROGRAM="/sbin/devmap_name %M %m", NAME="%k", SYMLINK="%c", OPTIONS+="last_rule"
